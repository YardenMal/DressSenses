Intelligent Interactive System Prototype

The main algoritmns as described in the final project are:
1. Color matching algorithm - CheckMyOutfit.ipynb.
2. Data Arrangement Algorithm: arrange_color_names_csv.ipynb which uses prev_color.csv file.
3. Recognized and marking colors: ColorIdentificationUsingML.ipynb. this algorithm also exists in the utils python file.

Inside the App folder you can find the interface code includes streamlit main app, system's utils, requierments.txt file, colors images folder, and all the images you need to run the app. In order to run the code please keep the order of this folder.

In order to run the interface you need to follow these instructions:
1. Download the code from Git as zip
2. Extract the zipped folder.
3. Open the "App" folder in a workspace (like pycharm).
4. In the terminal run the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. After the requirements.txt had been installed run the command: streamlit run main.py
6. A new window will open with the streamlit interface.
7. Start exploring your closet :)
