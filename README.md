Intelligent Interactive System Prototype
The main algoritmns as described in the final project are:
1. Color matching algorithm - CheckMyOutfit.ipynb.
2. Data Arrangement Algorithm: arrange_color_names_csv.ipynb which uses prev_color.csv file.
3. Recognized and marking colors: ColorIdentificationUsingML.ipynb. this algorithm also exists in the utils python file.
Inside the App folder you can find the interface code includes streamlit main app, system's utils, requierments.txt file, colors images folder, and all the images you need to run the app. In order to run the code please keep the order of this folder.
